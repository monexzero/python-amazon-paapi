# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'python-amazon-paapi'
copyright = '2021, Sergio Abad'
author = 'Sergio Abad'

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release = '4.2.0'


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',
    'myst_parser'
]

# Don't show type hints in the signature - that just makes it hardly readable
# and we document the types anyway
autodoc_typehints = 'none'

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ['_templates']

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = ['_build', 'Thumbs.db', '.DS_Store']

# The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.
pygments_style = 'sphinx'

# If true, `todo` and `todoList` produce output, else they produce nothing.
todo_include_todos = False


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'

html_theme_options = {
    'style_external_links': True,
}

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ['_static']

# The name of an image file (relative to this directory) to place at the top
# of the sidebar.
html_logo = '_static/pa-paapi-logo.png'

# The name of an image file (within the static path) to use as favicon of the
# docs.  This file should be a Windows icon file (.ico) being 16x16 or 32x32
# pixels large.
html_favicon = '_static/pa-paapi-icon.ico'
